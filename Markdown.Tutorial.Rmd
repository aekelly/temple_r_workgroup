```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#@ this is where you can set the defaults for your chunks.
#@ so, say, if you want the default ot echo to be FALSE, here is where you do it.
#@ include=F here means that this chunk will not be included in the final .html doc
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Now for some other features:
Code comes in chunks, which can be interspersed with text

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 3
abc <- c(a,b,c)
abc
#rm(list=ls())
abc
```


```{r}
profane <- read.csv("data/profane.csv")
head(profane)
summary(profane)

abc

```

1. *a hilariously complicated cheat sheet *

2. **slightly confusing step-by-step**

3. using KnitR, the program? which renders your file

4. _and a cute youtube video_

Using two spaces between lines in text-regions starts a new paragraph, which can be annoying when you forget.  




#Same Functionality
Here's a copy of what we did in our last session:
First, we don't want to re-install packages every time,
so we change the .rmd default from eval=T to eval=F
Then, when the .rmd file is knit, this chunk will not be evaluated.
```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot")
```
and (look at the .rmd) you can hide the code of the next two chunks with echo=F  
the chunk below is neither evaluated nor shown, but check the .rmd file
```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
#@ this chunk is a repeat of the previous one, neither evaluated (eval=F) nor shown (echo=F)
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot")
```


```{r echo=F}
#@ this chunk is new, and the code is also hidden thought it is evaluated.  
#@ You still see the results in the Knit html doc
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)
require(reshape2)
require(tidyverse)

linear.df <- read.csv("data/linear.csv", header=T)

head(linear.df)

colnames(linear.df)
linmelt <- linear.df %>% melt(measure.var=c(15:54), id.var=c(2,7,9))
#linmelt
#visualizing large objects in the knit file can be very ponderous - try removing the # on the linmelt line, and re-knitting!  ouch.
```

#back to the chunk defaults
```{r}
lms <- mutate(linmelt, time=substr(variable, start=4, stop=5))
table(lms$time)



lms$time<-as.numeric(lms$time)
table(lms$Cond)
dim(lms)
colnames(lms)
rownames(head(lms))


length(unique(lms$Subject))
table(lms[lms$Subject==2,]$variable)

?unique()
```
Keeping chunks small makes it easy to evaluate them one by one.  
It also helps if you want to toggle default settings like echo between chunks.
```{r collapse=T, message=F}
lincond <- group_by(lms, Cond, time)
lincond <- summarize(lincond, mean=mean(value, na.rm=T))
lincond
str(lincond)
```
###Sometimes all you want is a nice graph
```{r echo=F, message=F}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=lincond, aes(x=time, y=mean, color=Cond)) +
  geom_smooth(fill=NA)+
  geom_point()
```
  
...that was nice.
```{r}
```
#####Message=F is great
When you don't want to see random console output (like methods r is employing).  
The spacing above was acting strangely, hence the empty chunk.  RMarkdown is a strange beast.
```{r message=F}
# Setting working directory (we don't need to do this)
###@ setwd("c:/data/downloads/")
###@ setwd("C:/Users/klugman/Dropbox/r/data")
# Reading in data
linear<-read.csv("data/linear.csv", header=T)

# Installing formatR package to do RMarkdown
# have to choose 0-Cloud mirror for lab computers
chooseCRANmirror(ind=1)
install.packages("formatR")
library(formatR)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)


# converting linear to tbl
linear<-as.tbl(linear)

# looking at data
head(linear)
linear

# creating vector of bin variable names
linnames=colnames(linear)[15:54]
```
the chunk just above is collapsed


```{r}
# reshaping data
# "linear" is a subject*word*decisecond dataset, there are 22 subjects, 49 words, and 40 deciseconds per subject*word
# "binxx" variables contain data on pupil diameter
# there are four categories of words ("Cond"): Profane, Technical, Non-Word, Neutral
# we are reshaping so there are now 49*40 lines per subject
linmelt<-melt(linear, id.vars=c("ID", "Subject", "Item", "Cond"), measure.vars=linnames)

# creating clock variable that just contains numerals 1-40 (as opposed to "Bin1", "Bin2", etc)
linmelt<-mutate(linmelt, time=substr(variable, start=4, stop=5))
linmelt$time<-as.numeric(linmelt$time)

# Tracing pupil diameters over time for each profane word
ggplot(linmelt[linmelt$Cond=="Profane",], aes(x=time, y=value, color=Item))+
  geom_smooth(fill=NA)


# collapsing the dataset to average across all subjects and words within condition*time
# so we will have a dataset that is 40 lines per condition, for a total of 160 lines
lincond<-group_by(linmelt, Cond, time)
lincond<-summarize(lincond, mean=mean(value, na.rm=T))
lincond
```



#no echo 
```{r echo=F}
# plotting average pupil length by time for each condition
ggplot(data=lincond, aes(x=time, y=mean, color=Cond))+
  geom_smooth(fill=NA)+
  geom_point()
```



*here's some* **other** *code using some other data*

#A Very Tiny Time Series
plotting for for a friend
```{r ethans_chunk}

require(reshape2)
require(ggplot2)


# setwd("~/Box Sync/TEMPLE/WBCA/R stuff/for_friends/")
#no more working directories!

ethan2 <-  read.csv("data/NAEPdata.csv", header=T)
ethan <- ethan2

years <-c("score", 1998, 2006, 2010, 2014)
colnames(ethan) <- years

levels(ethan$score)
#ethan$score <- reorder(ethan$score, new.order=c(3,2,4,1))  
#@ this doesn't work At All.  
#@I think it actually reorders which observation GETS which factor, not their relative ranking
#@ ----- Is there a way to re-order factors from their alphabetical default?

levels(ethan$score)

ethanL <- melt(ethan, id.vars="score")
ethanL
colnames(ethanL) <- c("score", "year", "value")



eplot <- ggplot(data=ethanL, aes(x=year, y=value, group=score, color=score), main="Proficiency by year")+geom_point()+geom_line()

eplot + labs(title="Student Proficiency by Year")
```

#that's all folks
